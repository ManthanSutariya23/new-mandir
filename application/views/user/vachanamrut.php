                            <p>In the Samvat year 1876, on the night of Mãgshar sud 6 [22nd November, 1819], Shreeji Mahãrãj was sitting in Dãdã Khãchar’s darbãr in Gadhadã. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. A sabhã of munis, as well as haribhaktas from various places, had gathered before Him.</p>
                            <p>Shreeji Mahãrãj then said, “Even a person who can constantly see the murti of Bhagvãn in his heart, should recall the leelãs performed by Bhagvãn in His different avatãrs in different places. He should also maintain love for brahm-chãris, sãdhus and satsangis, and should always remember them. If at the time of death he forgets the murti of Bhagvãn, but remembers the leelãs performed by Him in the different places, or if he remembers satsangis, brahm-chãris or sãdhus, then he will also remember the murti of Bhagvãn. In this way, that person attains a high spiritual status and benefits greatly. That is why I perform grand Vishnu-yãgs, annually celebrate Janamãshtmi, Ekãdashi, and other festivals, and gather brahm-chãris, sãdhus and satsangis on these occasions. Even a sinner who remembers these occasions at the time of death, can attain Akshardhãm.”</p>
